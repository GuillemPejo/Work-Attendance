# Work-Attendance

Basic script to automatize your work attendance

## How to use

First of all, put your employe id 
```
ID = "123"
```

If you have taken holidays this month, simply add the days to the array: 
```
HOLIDAYS = [ 4, 5, 6, 15, 16]
```


And this is all,  just run attendance script, and this creates a csv file with the output data ready to import
```
python attendance_script.py
```
